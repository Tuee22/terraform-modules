## Repository Overview

This repository contains infrastructure as code designed to automate the creation of cloud resources using both **Terraform** and **Packer**. The current focus is on provisioning VPCs and building machine images on **AWS** and **GCP** using a vendor-agnostic approach.

The repository is structured to allow both **Terraform** and **Packer** jobs to be run in parallel across multiple cloud providers. By abstracting the common components (e.g., VPCs, subnets, security groups), the repository enables developers to describe cloud resources generically, allowing rich Terraform deployments to be defined in a way that works on **either cloud vendor**.

### Directory Structure
- **`terraform/`**: Contains the Terraform modules for provisioning cloud infrastructure.
  - **`aws/`**: AWS-specific Terraform configurations.
  - **`gcp/`**: GCP-specific Terraform configurations.
  - **`modules/`**: Reusable modules for common cloud resources (e.g., VPCs).
- **`packer/`**: Contains Packer configurations for building machine images.
  - **`aws/`**: AWS-specific Packer configurations.
  - **`gcp/`**: GCP-specific Packer configurations.
- **`scripts/`**: Automation scripts for managing builds and deployments (e.g., `build_images.sh`).

## Instructions for a Language Model (LLM)

### Purpose
When integrating with this repository or creating new modules, the key principle is to maintain **vendor-agnosticity** wherever possible. This ensures that infrastructure deployments can be defined in a way that allows for portability and reusability across multiple cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, etc.).

This repository follows these goals:
1. **Vendor-Agnostic Infrastructure Modules**: Common components like VPCs, subnets, security groups, and firewalls should be described in terms of **generic attributes**. Outputs from these modules (e.g., `vpc_id`, `public_subnet_ids`) must be standardized to avoid vendor-specific terminology, allowing other Terraform resources (such as VMs or Kubernetes clusters) to interact with these outputs consistently across providers.
   
2. **Modular Design**: Each module should encapsulate a distinct piece of functionality (e.g., creating a VPC, building machine images) and expose variables and outputs that are agnostic of the underlying cloud provider whenever possible.

### Key Concepts and Terminology

- **Vendor-Agnostic Objects**: 
  - When defining resources, avoid using AWS- or GCP-specific terms in the interfaces (inputs and outputs) of Terraform modules. For example, a VPC module should output generic terms like `vpc_id` and `subnet_ids` instead of vendor-specific terminology (e.g., `aws_vpc_id` or `gcp_network_id`).
  - Use variables that are common across vendors, such as `cidr_blocks`, `enable_nat_gateway`, and `enable_ssh`, to configure network resources generically.

- **Cloud-Provider Specifics Encapsulated**:
  - Vendor-specific logic should only be implemented within the confines of each provider-specific module (`aws/main.tf` and `gcp/main.tf`), and it should not leak into other parts of the Terraform codebase.

### Principles for Adding New Modules

1. **Abstract the Logic**:
   - If you're adding a new module (e.g., a VM or Kubernetes cluster), first define a generic set of variables and outputs that can be used across cloud providers. Ensure the names and types of variables are generic, e.g., use `instance_type` instead of `aws_instance_type`.
   
2. **Encapsulate Vendor-Specific Code**:
   - In each module, write separate configurations for AWS, GCP, or any other provider, and isolate these configurations behind a consistent interface.
   
3. **Use Consistent Outputs**:
   - Outputs from modules should be consistent and standardized across providers. For example, a module that creates VMs should output `vm_id` and `vm_ip_address` rather than `aws_instance_id` or `gcp_instance_id`.

4. **Support Extensibility**:
   - Each module should be extensible and allow for configuration that enables specific features, like SSH access or enabling a NAT Gateway. Use flags (e.g., `enable_ssh`, `enable_nat_gateway`) to make these features configurable.

5. **Parallelism and Modular Execution**:
   - Ensure modules can run in parallel and that cloud resources are created independently when possible (e.g., provisioning AWS and GCP resources simultaneously).
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies between resources in different cloud providers.

6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Each new module should be tested on multiple providers to ensure that it behaves consistently across platforms. Ensure that modules fail gracefully in the case of cloud-specific limitations.

## Sample Prompt for LLM

> "This repository is designed to provision cloud infrastructure and build images across multiple cloud providers (AWS and GCP) using Terraform and Packer. The goal is to keep all modules vendor-agnostic, meaning that resources like VPCs, VMs, and security groups should be described generically, allowing them to be used interchangeably across providers. Outputs must be consistent (e.g., `vpc_id`, `subnet_ids`), and the logic specific to AWS or GCP should be encapsulated within the respective provider modules. Please assist with extending this repository by adding a new module for creating Kubernetes clusters, ensuring that it can be used generically across providers by following the vendor-agnostic principles."

By following these principles and prompts, developers can ensure that the infrastructure modules in this repository remain portable, reusable, and consistent across different cloud providers.

This README file will guide any future additions and ensure the repository remains consistent with the goal of vendor-agnostic, modular cloud infrastructure management.
