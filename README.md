# Project Overview

This project contains infrastructure automation scripts and configurations designed to work with both **AWS** and **GCP**. It uses **Terraform** for provisioning cloud resources and **Packer** for building machine images.

The repository is structured to support vendor-agnostic modules that allow rich Terraform deployments to be described generically, enabling portability across cloud providers.
